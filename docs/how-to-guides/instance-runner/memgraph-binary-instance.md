import Neo4jWarning from '../../templates/_neo4j_warning.mdx';

Through this guide, you will learn how to start, stop, connect to and monitor
Memgraph instances with GQLAlchemy.

<Neo4jWarning/>

First, perform all the necessary imports:

```python
from gqlalchemy.instance_runner import MemgraphInstanceBinary
```

## Start the Memgraph instance

:::warning

In order to start a Memgraph instance that you installed using `dpkg`, you need
to run the binary file as user `memgraph`. Otherwise, the process won't have the
right access rights to the needed directories and files.

:::

The following code will create a Memgraph instance, start it and return a
connection object:

```python
memgraph_instance = MemgraphInstanceBinary(
    host="0.0.0.0", port=7698, binary_path="/usr/lib/memgraph/memgraph", user="memgraph"
)
memgraph = memgraph_instance.start_and_connect(restart=False)
```

We used the default values for the arguments:

- `host="0.0.0.0"`: This is the wildcard address which indicates that the
  instance should accept connections from all interfaces.
- `port=7687`: This is the default port Memgraph listens to.
- `binary_path="/usr/lib/memgraph/memgraph"`: The default location of the
  Memgraph binary file on Ubuntu.
- `user="memgraph"`: The user that will start the Memgraph process.
- `restart=False`: If the instance is already running, it won't be stopped and
  started again.

After we have created the connection, we can start querying the database:

```python
memgraph.execute_and_fetch("RETURN 'Memgraph is running' AS result"))[0]["result"]
```

## Pass configuration flags

You can pass [configuration flags](/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration)
using a dictionary:

```python
config={"--log-level": "TRACE"}
memgraph_instance = MemgraphInstanceBinary(config=config)
```

## Stop the Memgraph instance

To stop a Memgraph instance, call the `stop()` method:

```python
memgraph_instance.stop()
```

## Check if a Memgraph instance is running

To check if a Memgraph instance is running, call the `is_running()` method:

```python
memgraph_instance.is_running()
```
