import Neo4jWarning from '../../templates/_neo4j_warning.mdx';

Through this guide, you will learn how to start, stop, connect to and monitor
Memgraph instances with GQLAlchemy.

<Neo4jWarning/>

First, perform all the necessary imports:

```python
from gqlalchemy.instance_runner import (
    DockerImage,
    MemgraphInstanceDocker
)
```

## Start the Memgraph instance

The following code will create a Memgraph instance, start it and return a
connection object:

```python
memgraph_instance = MemgraphInstanceDocker(
    docker_image=DockerImage.MEMGRAPH, docker_image_tag="latest", host="0.0.0.0", port=7687
)
memgraph = memgraph_instance.start_and_connect(restart=False)
```

We used the default values for the arguments:

- `docker_image=DockerImage.MEMGRAPH`: This will start the `memgraph/memgraph`
  Docker image.
- `docker_image_tag="latest"`: We use the `latest` tag to start the most recent
  version of Memgraph.
- `host="0.0.0.0"`: This is the wildcard address which indicates that the
  instance should accept connections from all interfaces.
- `port=7687`: This is the default port Memgraph listens to.
- `restart=False`: If the instance is already running, it won't be stopped and
  started again.

After we have created the connection, we can start querying the database:

```python
memgraph.execute_and_fetch("RETURN 'Memgraph is running' AS result"))[0]["result"]
```

## Pass configuration flags

You can pass [configuration flags](/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration)
using a dictionary:

```python
config={"--log-level": "TRACE"}
memgraph_instance = MemgraphInstanceDocker(config=config)
```

## Stop the Memgraph instance

To stop a Memgraph instance, call the `stop()` method:

```python
memgraph_instance.stop()
```

## Check if a Memgraph instance is running

To check if a Memgraph instance is running, call the `is_running()` method:

```python
memgraph_instance.is_running()
```
