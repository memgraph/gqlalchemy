Since Memgraph is an in-memory graph database, the GQLAlchemy library provides
an on-disk storage solution for large properties not used in graph algorithms.
This is useful when nodes or relationships have metadata that doesnâ€™t need to be
used in any of the graph algorithms that need to be carried out in Memgraph, but
can be fetched after. In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to use an SQL
database to store node properties seamlessly as if they were being stored in
Memgraph.

## Connect to Memgraph and an SQL database

First you need to do all necessary imports and connect to the running Memgraph
and SQL database instance:

```python
from gqlalchemy import Memgraph, SQLitePropertyDatabase, Node, Field
from typing import Optional

graphdb = Memgraph()
SQLitePropertyDatabase('path-to-my-db.db', graphdb)
```

The `graphdb` creates a connection to an in-memory graph database and
`SQLitePropertyDatabase` attaches to `graphdb` in its constructor.

## Define schema

For example, you can create the class `User` which maps to a node object in the
graph database.

```python
class User(Node):
    id: int = Field(unique=True, exists=True, index=True, db=graphdb)
    huge_string: Optional[str] = Field(on_disk=True)
```

Here the property `id` is a required `int` that creates uniqueness and existence
constraints inside Memgraph. You can notice that the property `id` is also
indexed on label `User`. The `huge_string` property is optional, and because the
`on_disk` argument is set to `True`, it will be saved into the SQLite database.

## Create data

Next, you can create some huge string, which won't be saved into the graph
database, but rather into the SQLite databse.

```python
my_secret = "I LOVE DUCKS" * 1000
john = User(id=5, huge_string=my_secret).save(db)
john2 = User(id=5).load(db)
print(john2.huge_string)  # prints I LOVE DUCKS, a 1000 times
```

Hopefully this guide has taught you how to use on-disk storage along with the
in-memory graph database. If you have any more questions, join our community and
