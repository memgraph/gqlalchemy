## v1.4.1 - April 19, 2023

### Features and improvements

- Installing and testing GQLAlchemy is now easier because Apache Arrow, PyTorch Geometric and DGL dependencies have been made optional. [#235](https://github.com/memgraph/gqlalchemy/pull/235)

## v1.4 - March 10, 2023

### Features and improvements

- Data from Memgraph can now be [imported from](/reference/transformations/importing/graph_importer.md) and [exported to](/reference/transformations/export/graph_transporter.md) `NetworkX`, `DGL` and `PyG` graph formats. [#215](https://github.com/memgraph/gqlalchemy/pull/215)
