**GQLAlchemy** is a fully open-source Python library and **Object Graph Mapper** (OGM) - a link between graph database objects and Python objects.

An Object Graph Mapper or OGM provides a developer-friendly workflow that allows for writing object-oriented notation to communicate with graph databases. Instead of writing Cypher queries, you will be able to write object-oriented code, which the OGM will automatically translate into Cypher queries.

## Installation

GQLAlchemy is built on top of Memgraph's low-level Python client `pymgclient`
([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pymgclient/) /
[Documentation](https://memgraph.github.io/pymgclient/) /
[GitHub](https://github.com/memgraph/pymgclient)). 

To install GQLAlchemy, you first need to install `pymgclient` [build prerequisites](https://memgraph.github.io/pymgclient/introduction.html#build-prerequisites).

After you have installed the prerequisites, run the following command:

`pip install gqlalchemy`

With the above command, you get the basic GQLAlchemy capabilities. To add additional import/export capabilities, install GQLAlchemy with one of the following commands:

- `pip install gqlalchemy[arrow]` # Support for the CSV, Parquet, ORC and IPC/Feather/Arrow formats
- `pip install gqlalchemy[dgl]` # DGL support (includes PyTorch)

- `pip install gqlalchemy[all]` # All of the above

If you intend to use GQLAlchemy with PyTorch Geometric support, that library must be installed manually:

```bash
pip install gqlalchemy[torch_pyg] # prerequisite
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv torch-geometric -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.13.0+cpu.html"
```

If you are using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for Python environment management, you can install GQLAlchemy through pip.

## Build & Test

The project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to build the library. Clone or download the [GQLAlchemy source code](https://github.com/memgraph/gqlalchemy) locally and run the following command to build it from source with Poetry:

```bash
poetry install --all-extras
```

The ``poetry install --all-extras`` command installs GQLAlchemy with all extras
(optional dependencies). Alternatively, you can use the ``-E`` option to define
what extras to install:

```bash
poetry install # No extras

poetry install -E arrow # Support for the CSV, Parquet, ORC and IPC/Feather/Arrow formats
poetry install -E dgl # DGL support (also includes torch)
```

To run the tests, make sure you have an [active Memgraph instance](https://memgraph.com/docs/getting-started), and execute one of the following commands:

```bash
poetry run pytest . -k "not slow" # If all extras installed

poetry run pytest . -k "not slow and not extras" # Otherwise
```

If you’ve installed only certain extras, it’s also possible to run their associated tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest . -k "arrow"
poetry run pytest . -k "dgl"
```
## Development (how to build)

```bash
poetry run flake8 .
poetry run black .
poetry run pytest . -k "not slow and not extras"
```

## Documentation

The GQLAlchemy documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/memgraph/gqlalchemy).

The documentation can be generated by executing:
```
pip3 install pydoc-markdown
pydoc-markdown
```
